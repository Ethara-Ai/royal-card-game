Act as a Frontend Architect to design and implement a production-ready interactive online card game interface using React. The goal is to create a polished, intuitive, and visually engaging trick-taking card game that feels like a real-world gaming product rather than a prototype. The game should support four players per match, consisting of one human player and three AI opponents, with a clear and natural layout that allows players to easily view, select, and play cards.
Begin by structuring the application into well-organized, reusable React components that separate game logic, UI elements, and configuration panels. Include a pre-game waiting room where players are represented by avatars with ready-state indicators. Once the match begins, render a poker-style oval table layout, positioning AI opponents at the top, left, and right, and displaying the human player's hand along the bottom. Implement smooth card-dealing animations and drag-to-play interactions, ensuring touch support for mobile devices. A central play area should clearly show cards as they are played during each trick.
The interface should include a live-updating leaderboard sidebar that displays player scores, rankings, and active turn indicators. Implement a complete end-of-game experience with a winner modal and celebratory visual effects. Provide a settings panel that allows users to customize card back themes (including multiple patterns such as checker, stripes, or diamonds), toggle between dark and light themes, and switch between different rule variations such as Highest Card Wins, Suit Follows, and Spades as trump.

Enhance the user experience with additional UI elements including a loading screen featuring an animated ace of spades, toast notifications for key game events, and dynamically generated player avatars using RoboHash. Visually, apply a casino-inspired aesthetic with a dark theme featuring a green felt table surface, gold accent highlights, and dark UI panels, alongside an optional light theme using softer mossy green tones. Ensure the layout is fully responsive, prioritizing desktop while maintaining strong mobile usability. Use CSS custom properties for theming, Cormorant Garamond for display typography, and Outfit for body text to achieve a refined and cohesive visual style.
